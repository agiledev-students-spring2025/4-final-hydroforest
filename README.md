# HydroForest

## Project Overview

HydroForest is a web app designed to help users track their daily water intake while making hydration a fun and rewarding experience. Every time a user logs a bottle of water, a virtual tree grows in their digital forest. Over time, consistent hydration leads to a thriving forest, encouraging users to build healthy habits through gamification.

## Product Vision Statement

HydroForest transforms the habit of drinking water into an engaging and rewarding experience by allowing users to grow a virtual forest as they stay hydrated.

## How It Works

From an end-user perspective, HydroForest will:

- Allow users to log their daily water intake (e.g., one bottle = tree growth).
- Visually represent progress through a growing virtual forest.
- Track historical hydration data to show trends over time.
- Gamify the experience with forest customization.
- Send reminders and notifications to encourage hydration.

## Project History

HydroForest began as an innovative project for our Agile Software Development & DevOps course, sparked by the everyday challenge of staying properly hydrated. Recognizing that many people struggle to drink enough water, our team set out to create a fun and engaging solution that makes hydration rewarding and interactive.

Our journey started with a dynamic brainstorming session where we explored creative ways to encourage healthy habits through digital incentives. The result was the concept of a virtual forest—each time users log their water intake, they are one step closer to build their own personal forest.

Using an **Agile** approach, we focused on building core functionality first and are continuously iterating to refine and enhance the experience. Here’s a snapshot of our progress so far:

- **Sprint 0**:
  We laid the foundation for HydroForest by creating the app map and prototype. This helped us visualize the user flow and define the core features, such as logging water intake, tracking hydration progress, and growing a virtual forest.

- **Sprint 1**:
  We completed the front-end development, bringing the app’s design to life. This included building the user interface for the hydration tracker, forest visualization, calendar page, social page and navigation system.
- **Sprint 2**:
  We completed the back-end development by building a Express.js server. Our team implemented dynamic API routes to handle user authentication, hydration logging, and tree selection functionality. We integrated mock JSON data to simulate database operations, ensuring that the front-end could retrieve and update hydration progress, unlock new trees, and manage user profiles.

Our goal is to deliver a polished, engaging product by the end of the semester that not only helps you stay hydrated but also makes the process enjoyable.
