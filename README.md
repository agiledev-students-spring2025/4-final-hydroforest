# 🌲 HydroForest

## 🚀 Project Overview

**HydroForest** is a full-stack web application that transforms hydration tracking into a fun and rewarding experience. Every time a user logs a bottle of water, a virtual tree grows in their digital forest. Over time, consistent hydration leads to a thriving virtual environment—gamifying the habit of staying hydrated.

## 🌟 Product Vision

*HydroForest turns daily water intake into an engaging, habit-forming experience by letting users grow a customizable forest as they hydrate.*

## 🧠 How It Works

From the user’s perspective, HydroForest provides the following features:

- Log daily water intake (e.g., 1 bottle = 1 tree growth)
- View progress through a growing visual forest
- Track hydration history over time
- Customize your forest with unlockable elements
- Receive hydration reminders and motivational notifications

## 📜 Project History

HydroForest began as part of our **Agile Software Development & DevOps** course, inspired by a shared challenge—drinking enough water. Our goal was to build a tool that makes hydration fun, motivating users with visual rewards and habit-forming gamification.

We followed an **Agile methodology**, continuously iterating through sprints to build and improve the app:

- **Sprint 0**  
  We built our app map and prototype to define the user flow and core features like hydration tracking, virtual forest growth, and progress history.

- **Sprint 1**  
  Focused on front-end development—designing the UI, hydration tracker, forest visualization, calendar view, social features, and navigation.

- **Sprint 2**  
  Back-end development with an Express.js server. We implemented dynamic API routes for:
  - User authentication
  - Hydration logging
  - Tree unlocking  
  Using mock JSON data, we connected front-end components to simulate full-stack functionality, including profile management and hydration history.

Our end goal: deliver a polished, engaging app that helps users build better habits by the end of the semester.
