# Guide to Contributing to Hydroforest

Welcome to Hydroforest! We appreciate your interest in contributing to our project. Please read this guide carefully before making any contributions. If you have any questions, please reach out to project founders.

## Team Norms
- **Collaboration First**: We value open communication and teamwork.
- **Code Quality**: Maintain clean, readable, and well-documented code.
- **Respectful Environment**: Be respectful and constructive in all discussions.
- **Transparency**: Keep discussions public unless confidentiality is required.
- **Feedback**: Be open to receiving and giving constructive feedback.
- **User-Focus**: Keep users in mind when designing new features.

## Sprint cadence

- Sprints are usually two weeks long but could vary a few days based on the size of the features we're implementing. The team will decide when to use extensions based on the workload and time it is taking to finish our goals.

## Daily standups

 - We will have 45 minutes standups on weekdays based on members's availability. They will be conducted on zoom call and members will share their screens to show everyone what they've been up to and what holdups they may be having.
- Members who do not participate will be reported to management.
- Members who make no progress for two meetings and don't reach out for help will be reported to management.

## Coding standards

- We will use visual studio code
- Code for each task and spike must be peer-reviewed and pass tests before merging into the `main` branch of code.
- Always push working code, if you break the pipeline/build then fix it.
- Make granular and small commits, per feature or per bug fix.
- Provide descriptive commit messages.
- Write self documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening.
- Don't leave dead/commented out code behind. 
- Write automated tests to cover critical integration points and functionality
